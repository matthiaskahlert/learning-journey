# learning-journey
## Inhalt
This repo I created to document and implement my educationcourses in a practical way, rather than just consuming theory. My goal is to create visibility of the learned stuff, to have it at hands when I will need it again.

## Ordnerstruktur
Each subfolder contains:
```
javascript/
├── README.md               # Topics and learning goals, ggf. Lernziele
├── exercises/              # Intended for small coding examples
├── projects/               # own miniprojects
└── notes/                  # Markdown-notes
```

## Aufgaben
